### WakeMeApp
Tired of the same song for your alarms? Do you start hating your alarm songs?
This app lets you randomly play songs when the alarm time has come.
Stop hating your favorite song just because it is on your alarm.
WakeMeApp will let you break the routine and play a new song every day.

This project was inspired from the idea of stop hating my favorite song just because I hear it everyday at morning.
WakeMeApp lets the user create a playlist to randomly play one of those songs when the alarm must ring.
In that way, the user will hear a different song everyday and, with some luck, will stop hating the songs.
